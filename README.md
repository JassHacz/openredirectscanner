## ðŸŽ¯ What is this tool?

**OpenRedirectScanner** is a powerful, advanced open redirect vulnerability scanner with severity classification, built in Python by Jass. It helps identify, classify, and report open redirects across multiple endpoints with **multithreaded** speed and **color-coded** severity display.  

âœ… Classifies vulnerabilities as **Critical**, **Medium**, or **Low**  
âœ… Supports bulk scanning with a target file (`-f`) or a single URL (`-u`)  
âœ… Built-in **param scanning** for common redirect parameters  
âœ… Supports `--clean` to filter only HTTP/HTTPS URLs  
âœ… Supports `--export csv/json` for reporting  
âœ… Highâ€“quality colored terminal output for **confirmed**, **safe**, and **error** results  
âœ… Custom payloads to test advanced bypasses like `javascript://%250aalert(document.cookie)`  
âœ… Fully multithreaded for faster scanning  
âœ… Professional and easy to extend

## ðŸš€ How does it work?

The tool uses these common redirect parameters to fuzz:
- `next`
- `url`
- `redirect`
- `return`
- `to`
- `continue`

and tries multiple payloads like:
- `//evil.com`
- `https://evil.com`
- `//attacker.com`
- `javascript://%250aalert(document.cookie)`

It sends these payloads to each parameter of each target URL, then follows redirects and checks if the payload lands on an untrusted domain or triggers a `javascript:` scheme. Based on the response, it classifies the vulnerability as:

- **Critical** â†’ payload executes JavaScript  
- **Medium** â†’ external trusted domain redirect  
- **Low** â†’ suspicious but less risky redirect

## âš¡ Special Features

âœ… Colorâ€“coded output:
- **Critical** â†’ bold red  
- **Medium** â†’ bold yellow  
- **Low** â†’ bold cyan  
- confirmed vuln â†’ always bold green  
- safe â†’ white 

âœ… Clean mode:
- use `--clean` to remove non-HTTP(S) targets automatically

âœ… Export:
- use `--export csv` or `--export json` to store results

âœ… Fully threaded:
- use `--threads N` to control concurrency

âœ… False positive reduction:
- follows redirects completely to confirm the final landing page  
- handles network errors gracefully
